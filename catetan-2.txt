The error message you're seeing indicates that the NestJS application is unable to connect to the database. The specific error message Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:3306 suggests that the connection is being refused on the localhost (::1) at port 3306, which is the default port for MySQL.

There are a few possible reasons for this error:

    Incorrect database configuration: Make sure that the database configuration in your NestJS application is correct. Double-check the hostname, port number, username, password, and database name in your database configuration file (ormconfig.js or ormconfig.json) or in your environment variables.

    Database server not running: Ensure that your MySQL database server is running and accessible. Check if the MySQL service is active and listening on port 3306. You can try restarting the MySQL service or checking the server logs for any specific errors.

    Firewall or network restrictions: It's possible that a firewall or network configuration is blocking the connection between your NestJS application and the database server. Ensure that the necessary ports are open and accessible on your system or network.

    Incorrect database driver: Ensure that you have installed the correct database driver for MySQL in your NestJS application. In this case, you should have the mysql2 package installed. Verify that it's included as a dependency in your package.json file.

By investigating these possibilities, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the connection issue.
